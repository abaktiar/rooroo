# Rationale for v0.5.0 Architectural Changes: The Rooroo Evolution

Version 0.5.0 marks a significant evolution in the `rooroo` orchestration framework, introducing **breaking changes** aimed at enhancing user interaction, improving clarity in task management, and streamlining agent communication. This version shifts from the previous `.state/` and `Workflow Coordinator` model to a more integrated `.rooroo/` ecosystem orchestrated by the `Rooroo Navigator`.

## 1. Introducing the ðŸ§­ Rooroo Navigator: A More Interactive Project Guide (Breaking Change)

*   **Problem with v0.4.x:** The `Workflow Coordinator` in v0.4.x, while functional, was largely a backend process dispatcher. User interaction was somewhat indirect, and the agent's persona was less defined, potentially leading to a more mechanical experience. The system relied heavily on agents writing state files, which the Coordinator would then poll or react to.
*   **Solution (v0.5.0):** The `workflow-coordinator` is replaced by the **`Rooroo Navigator`**.
    *   **Enhanced User Interaction:** The Navigator is designed as a friendly, explicit, and interactive guide for the user. It has a distinct persona and communicates clearly about its actions, task statuses, and any decisions needed from the user, often using tools like `ask_followup_question`.
    *   **Direct Orchestration:** It directly manages the flow of tasks, from initial triage to dispatching to specialized Rooroo experts and processing their outputs.
    *   **`ROO#` Task ID System:** Introduces a consistent `ROO#` prefix for task identifiers (e.g., `ROO#PLAN_...`, `ROO#TEMP_...`, `ROO#SUB_...`), bringing a unified naming convention to the Rooroo ecosystem.
*   **Why it's Breaking:**
    *   The `workflow-coordinator` mode and its specific directives are removed.
    *   The interaction model changes; users now interact primarily with the `Rooroo Navigator` which has a new set of behaviors and communication patterns.
    *   The underlying logic for task processing, delegation, and status updates is entirely new.

## 2. The `.rooroo/` Namespace: Centralized & Structured Task Management (Breaking Change)

*   **Problem with v0.4.x:** While `task_queue.jsonl` and `task_log.jsonl` in `.state/` were steps towards better organization, task-specific context and agent outputs were less standardized and somewhat dispersed. Agent state files (`.state/tasks/TASK_ID.json`) served a dual purpose of state and detailed output, which could be cumbersome.
*   **Solution (v0.5.0):** A new, comprehensive **`.rooroo/` directory structure** is introduced:
    *   **`.rooroo/queue.jsonl`:** Retains its role for pending tasks, now managed by `rooroo-planner` and consumed by `rooroo-navigator`, using `ROO#` task IDs.
    *   **`.rooroo/logs/activity.jsonl`:** A dedicated log file (previously `task_log.jsonl` but now often in a `logs/` subdirectory) where the Navigator records events using a defined `SafeLogEvent` procedure.
    *   **`.rooroo/tasks/TASK_ID/`:** A crucial new structure. Each task (identified by its `ROO#` ID) gets its own directory.
        *   **`context.md`:** Within each task directory, a `context.md` file is created (typically by `rooroo-planner` for planned tasks or `rooroo-navigator` for simple/temporary tasks). This serves as the complete, detailed briefing for the assigned Rooroo expert.
        *   **`artifacts/AGENT_SLUG/`:** Each expert working on the task stores its specific outputs (files, data, reports) in a dedicated subdirectory under `artifacts/`. This provides a clear, organized location for all work products related to a task.
    *   **`.rooroo/plans/`:** For storing overview documents generated by `rooroo-planner`.
    *   **`.rooroo/brainstorming/`:** For notes from `rooroo-idea-sparker`.
*   **Why it's Breaking:**
    *   The entire `.state/` directory and its conventions are replaced by `.rooroo/`.
    *   Agents now expect their input (briefing) from a dedicated `context.md` file.
    *   Agent outputs are now saved to a standardized `artifacts/AGENT_SLUG/` path, not as part of a monolithic state file.
    *   The structure of `task_queue.jsonl` entries will reflect the new `ROO#` task IDs and context file paths.

## 3. Output Envelope Communication: Streamlined Agent Reporting (Breaking Change)

*   **Problem with v0.4.x:** Agents reported their status and detailed results by writing a JSON state file (`.state/tasks/TASK_ID.json`). The `Workflow Coordinator` then had to read and parse this file to understand the outcome. This could lead to I/O dependencies and a somewhat indirect communication flow.
*   **Solution (v0.5.0):** Agents now communicate their results directly back to the `Rooroo Navigator` via a structured **"Output Envelope"**.
    *   This is typically a single JSON string returned as the result of the agent's `attempt_completion` tool call.
    *   The envelope contains fields like `status` ("Done", "Failed", "NeedsClarification"), `message`, `output_artifact_paths` (linking to files in their `.rooroo/tasks/TASK_ID/artifacts/AGENT_SLUG/` directory), and `clarification_question` if needed.
    *   The `Rooroo Navigator` parses this JSON string directly to determine the task outcome and next steps.
*   **Why it's Breaking:**
    *   Agents no longer write comprehensive `.state/tasks/TASK_ID.json` files for status reporting. Their final action is to construct and return the Output Envelope string.
    *   The `Rooroo Navigator` expects this envelope string as the agent's output, not a file path to a state JSON.

## 4. Refined Agent Roles and Directives (Breaking Change)

*   **`rooroo-planner` (formerly `strategic-planner`):**
    *   Now explicitly creates the detailed `context.md` file for each sub-task it defines.
    *   Its output to the Navigator is an "Output Envelope" (specifically, a `PlannerOutput` like structure) containing the JSON lines for the queue and references to any plan overview documents.
*   **Executing Experts (e.g., `rooroo-developer`, `rooroo-analyzer`, `rooroo-documenter`):**
    *   Receive their task ID, the path to their `context.md` briefing, and a specific goal from the Navigator.
    *   Read all instructions and context from their dedicated `context.md`.
    *   Store all their generated files and work products in their designated `.rooroo/tasks/TASK_ID/artifacts/AGENT_SLUG/` directory.
    *   Report completion, failure, or the need for clarification by returning the standard Output Envelope JSON string to the Navigator.
*   **Why it's Breaking:**
    *   All agent `customInstructions` are significantly changed to reflect the new `rooroo-navigator` leadership, the `.rooroo/` file system, the `context.md` briefing mechanism, artifact storage, and Output Envelope communication.

These v0.5.0 changes collectively aim to create a more interactive, robust, and transparent AI orchestration system. The dedicated `context.md` files improve clarity for agents, standardized artifact locations simplify output management, and direct Output Envelope communication streamlines reporting to the `Rooroo Navigator`, who acts as a more engaging and effective project guide.

Version 0.5.0 is a significant step towards a more mature, robust, and user-friendly AI orchestration system. While these are breaking changes, they lay a stronger foundation for future development and more complex automated workflows.
