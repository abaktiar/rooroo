 # Rationale for v0.3.0 Architectural Changes

Version 0.3.0 introduces further refinements to the custom mode architecture, building upon the Coordinator-led, signal-driven model established in v0.2.0. These changes focus on enhancing project consistency, adaptability, and the robustness of task management.

## 1. Project-Wide Configuration (`project_configuration`)

*   **Problem:** While v0.2.0 improved orchestration, project-specific settings (like required tools, API endpoints, common environment variables, or style guides) still needed to be duplicated across various task contexts or were implicitly assumed. This could lead to inconsistencies or require manual adjustments within agent instructions for different projects.
*   **Solution (v0.3.0):** Introduced an optional, top-level `project_configuration` object within `project_overview.json`.
    *   **`Strategic Planner`:** Can now define these project-wide settings during the planning phase based on initial requirements.
    *   **`Workflow Coordinator`:** Explicitly instructed to **inject** this `project_configuration` object into the `context` (`delegation_details.context.project_config`) of each task it delegates.
    *   **Executing Agents (`Solution Architect`, `UX Specialist`, `Guardian Validator`, `DocuCrafter`, `Coder Monk`):** Instructed to **check for and utilize** this configuration from their input context, ensuring adherence to project standards (e.g., using the specified Python runner, referencing the correct design system URL).
*   **Benefit:**
    *   **Consistency:** Ensures all agents operate with the same project-specific parameters.
    *   **Reduced Redundancy:** Defines settings once in the overview, rather than repeating them in multiple task descriptions or contexts.
    *   **Adaptability:** Makes the workflow easily adaptable to different project environments by changing the configuration in one central place.

## 2. Centralized Sub-Task ID Assignment

*   **Problem:** In v0.2.x, agents like the `Solution Architect` generated sub-task IDs using potentially non-standard formats (e.g., `{parent_taskId}_sub{index}`). While the Coordinator integrated these, the final IDs lacked the consistent, sequential `NNN#type#subject` format used for top-level tasks planned by the `Strategic Planner`.
*   **Solution (v0.3.0):** Implemented a centralized ID assignment process managed by the `Workflow Coordinator`:
    *   **Agents (`Solution Architect`, etc.):** When defining sub-tasks in their state file's `new_tasks_to_integrate` array, they now use a **temporary** `taskId` format: `TEMP#type#subject`.
    *   **`Workflow Coordinator`:** When processing a completed task's state file, it:
        1.  Reads the `new_tasks_to_integrate` array.
        2.  Identifies tasks with `TEMP#...` IDs.
        3.  Reads the current `project_overview.json` to find the highest numerical prefix (`NNN`) used so far.
        4.  Assigns the next available sequential `NNN` prefix (incrementing by 10, e.g., 010, 020, 030...) to each temporary task, replacing `TEMP#type#subject` with the final `NNN#type#subject` ID.
        5.  Integrates these tasks with their **final, properly formatted IDs** into the `project_overview.json` during the batch update.
*   **Benefit:**
    *   **Consistency:** Ensures *all* tasks in `project_overview.json`, whether planned initially or generated mid-workflow, adhere to the standard `NNN#type#subject` format.
    *   **Robustness:** Centralizes ID generation logic within the Coordinator, preventing potential conflicts or inconsistencies from distributed ID creation.

These v0.3.0 changes represent incremental improvements focused on configuration management and task ID consistency, making the `rooroo` system more robust and easier to manage for diverse projects. They do not fundamentally alter the core Coordinator-led, signal-driven workflow but refine its implementation details.
